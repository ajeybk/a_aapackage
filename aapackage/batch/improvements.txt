- Need to review functions :

    - util_batch.py :

        - batch_run_infolder :
            - check if main_file_run exists
            - return new foldername

        - batch_generate_hyperparameters :
            - need to define what is df
            - need to check if hyper_dict has "key" key, and "min"/"max" keys for "key" key

        - batch_parallel_subprocess :
            - check if subprocess_script exists
            - is csv really needed ? because, for each line in the csv file,
                subprocess_script is called with --hyperparam_ii={line_number}, why ?
                A for loop can do the job

    - util_log.py :

        - create_appid :
            - check if filename is empty

        - create_logfilename :
            - raise exception if filename is empty (in order to avoir .log  file)

        - printlog :
            - if writelog:  what is this ?



What's been done :

    - util_batch.py :

        - os_folder_rename :
            - If new_folder exists , finds new name (recursively)
            - returns new name

        - batch_generate_hyperparameters :
            - commented lines involving df

    - util_log.py

        - create_uniqueid :
            - added a return
